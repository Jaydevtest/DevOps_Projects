### 1. Sudo Command
Sudo is short for superuser do, this is one of the most popular basic Linux commands that lets you perform tasks that require administrative or root permission. 

when using sudo, the system will prompt users to authenticate themselves with a password. Then, the Linux system will log a timestamp as a tracker. By default, every root user can run sudo commands for a 15-minute session. 

If you try to run sudo in the command line without authenticating yourself, the system will log the activity as a security event.


Here is a general syntax:

sudo (command e.g apt upgrade)
